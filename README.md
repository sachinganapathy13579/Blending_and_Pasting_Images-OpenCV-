## For some computer vision systems, we'll want to be able to post our own image on top of an already existing image or video. We may also want to blend images, maybe we want to have a "highlight" effect instead of just a solid box or empty rectangle.

## Let's explore what is commonly known as **Arithmetic Image Operations** with OpenCV. These are referred to as Arithmetic Operations because OpenCV is simply performing some common math with the pixels for the final effect. We'll see a bit of this in our code.
